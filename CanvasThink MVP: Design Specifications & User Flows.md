# CanvasThink MVP: Design Specifications & User Flows

## The Visual Language of Joyful Commerce

Design is not decoration; it is communication. Every pixel, every color, every interaction must serve the greater purpose of delivering an experience that is not just functional, but truly delightful. The visual language of CanvasThink will embody our core philosophy: simplicity as the ultimate sophistication, quality as the foundation of trust, and user delight as the measure of success.

## Visual Identity & Design System

### Color Palette: Sophisticated Minimalism

**Primary Colors:**
- **Pure White (#FFFFFF):** The foundation of our design, representing clarity, purity, and the absence of clutter. Used for backgrounds and negative space to create breathing room.
- **Deep Charcoal (#1A1A1A):** Our primary text color, providing maximum readability while maintaining elegance. Used for headlines, body text, and primary navigation.
- **Warm Gray (#6B7280):** Secondary text color for supporting information, subtle labels, and less critical content. Creates hierarchy without harshness.

**Accent Colors:**
- **Refined Gold (#D4AF37):** Used sparingly for premium indicators, quality badges, and moments of celebration (e.g., successful purchases). Represents the curated excellence of our products.
- **Soft Blue (#3B82F6):** Interactive elements, links, and call-to-action buttons. Trustworthy and calming, encouraging user engagement.
- **Success Green (#10B981):** Confirmation states, positive feedback, and completion indicators.
