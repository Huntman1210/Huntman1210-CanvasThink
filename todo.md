## CanvasThink ER-AI Enhancement Progress

- [ ] Phase 1: Conduct in-depth research on advanced AI techniques for emotional recognition, behavioral psychology in e-commerce, and ethical data collection for ER-AI.
- [ ] Phase 2: Develop a core ER-AI prototype capable of processing simulated user interaction data and inferring emotional states/preferences.
- [ ] Phase 3: Integrate the ER-AI prototype into a simplified CanvasThink interface to demonstrate its personalization capabilities.
- [ ] Phase 4: Deploy and rigorously test the ER-AI integrated prototype, gathering simulated user feedback.
- [ ] Phase 5: Implement Emotional Granularity Expansion (micro-states, intensity scaling, transition prediction) in ER-AI.
- [x] Phase 6: Implement Behavioral Pattern Recognition enhancements (dwell time, scroll velocity, multi-session tracking) in ER-AI.
- [x] Phase 7: Integrate enhanced ER-AI capabilities into the CanvasThink interface.
- [x] Phase 8: Deploy and rigorously test the enhanced ER-AI integrated prototype.
- [x] Phase 9: Analyze test results, refine the ER-AI model, and plan for future scaling.
